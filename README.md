# NFL-Big-Data-Bowl-2022

Howdy! This repository contains: a text file with SQL code that was used to clean the data and a jupyter notebook file that contains my NFL Big Data Bowl 2022 submission. 

Note, due to some strange compatability issues, I have removed the output of the animated punt returns. They can be seen in the Kaggle Notebook and the code is still present in the notebook hosted here.
